# Maze Generator/Solver Project
This project is a both a maze generator and solver than I created to showcase my custom built OpenGL batch renderer. When The program is ran, you can input the desired size for your maze, and the maze will be generated and displayed.
You can then press space, and the maze will be automatically solved and the solution will be displayed in green. You can also move the maze around using the wasd keys and zoom in and out using the up and down arrow keys in order to
get a better look at the maze.

## Compiling/building
To build the project, simply open the visual studio solution and compile in x86 either release or debug.

## Libraries used
glfw - window creation/input handling
glew - expose OpenGL functions for use
cglm - linear algebra functions
stbimage - for texture loading
